# hello-world
first project
This is my first project with free code camp.
I have no previous experience with Frontend Development.
Doing assignments at this point seem a little unclear to me, but I hope I will can make effective use of my time during these training sessions.
Talk to you soon. I am sure there will be more updates.
John
